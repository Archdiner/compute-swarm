been working on something for the x402 hackathon—

it's a p2p gpu marketplace where the buyer can be an AI agent.

agents hit a wall when they need serious compute. they can't sign up for aws, pass kyc, or click "deploy instance."

but they can hold a wallet.

so we built infrastructure where agents can:
• fine-tune themselves on new domains (lora adapters)  
• run 70B models they can't fit locally
• process massive datasets for rag indexing
• generate images/video on demand

no accounts. just wallet auth + streaming usdc payments per second.

still early, but the idea is simple: what if compute was a utility that software could tap into the same way we plug into electricity?

I'm excited to share what I've been building for the x402 Hackathon: ComputeSwarm.

The Problem:
AI Agents are getting powerful—but they hit a wall when they need heavy compute. They can't sign up for AWS. They can't pass KYC. They have wallets, not credit cards.

Existing cloud infrastructure is built for humans. Agents need something different.

The Solution:
ComputeSwarm is a decentralized GPU marketplace designed for autonomous software.

✅ Wallet-Native Auth: No accounts. The agent's private key IS the login.
✅ Streaming Payments: Pay USDC per second via the x402 protocol on Base L2.
✅ Any Workload: Fine-tuning, inference, data processing, image generation—send any Docker job.

Why This Matters:
I believe that in a few years, most GPU hours will be consumed by software, not people. ComputeSwarm is building the infrastructure for that future.

We're treating compute like a utility—the same way electricity or water flows to where it's needed.

Would love your feedback. Does "Compute for Agents" resonate as a category?
